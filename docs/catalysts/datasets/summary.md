This section provides documentation for all catalyst-related datasets in the Open Catalyst Project. These datasets are used to train and evaluate machine learning models for heterogeneous catalysis applications.

:::{tip}
For most new users, we recommend starting with the [UMA model](../../core/uma), which has been trained on all of these datasets and provides state-of-the-art performance.
