# OC25

The Open Catalyst 2025 (OC25) dataset consists of nearly 8 million DFT calculations across 1.5 million unique explicit solvent environments with system sizes of 144 atoms on average. This dataset represents the largest and most diverse solid-liquid interface dataset that is currently available and provides configurational and elemental diversity: spanning 88 elements, commonly used solvents/ions, varying solvent layers, and off-equilibrium sampling.

The dataset enables training of state-of-the-art machine-learned interatomic
potentials for applications in electrocatalysis. All structures are labeled
with total energies (eV) and forces (eV/Ã…) computed using VASP with the
RPBE+D3 functional.

All information about the dataset is available at the
[OC25 Huggingface site](https://huggingface.co/facebook/OC25).

## Dataset format

The dataset is provided in ASE DB compatible lmdb files (`*.aselmdb`).
