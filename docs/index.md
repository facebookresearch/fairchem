```

UMA is trained on 500M+ DFT calculations across molecules, materials, and catalysts — achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with energy conservation and fast inference.

:::{attention} FAIRChem v2 is here!
FAIRChem v2 introduces the **UMA model** — a universal machine learning potential for atoms.
This is a breaking change from v1 and is not compatible with previous pretrained models.
