# FAIR-Chem overview

`fairchem` is the [FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/) Chemistry's centralized repository of all its data, models, demos, and application efforts
for materials science and quantum chemistry. 

## FAIR-Chem is undergoing a major revision (2.0) and we will be updating this page with the latest instructions soon, please stay tuned!
In the meantime, the latest instructions for trying out Fairchem2.0 is on the [github page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairchem).

# Datasets in `fairchem`:
`fairchem` provides training and evaluation code for tasks and models that take arbitrary
chemical structures as input to predict energies / forces / positions / stresses,
and can be used as a base scaffold for research projects. For an overview of
tasks, data, and metrics, please read the documentations and respective papers:
 - [OC20](catalysts/datasets/oc20)
 - [OC22](catalysts/datasets/oc22)
 - [ODAC23](dac/datasets/odac)
 - [OC20Dense](catalysts/datasets/oc20dense)
 - [OC20NEB](catalysts/datasets/oc20neb)
 - [OMat24](inorganic_materials/datasets/omat24)
