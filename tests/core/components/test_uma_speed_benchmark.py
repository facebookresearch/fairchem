"""
GPU-only tests for the UMA inference speed benchmark runner.

These tests exercise the same code path as invoking:
    fairchem -c configs/uma/benchmark/uma-speed.yaml +run_dir_root=/tmp/

We reuse a tiny trained checkpoint produced by the existing UMA training
fixtures (`direct_mole_checkpoint`) to keep runtime minimal while still
loading a valid model. We then run the benchmark twice:
  1. Using natoms_list (synthetic FCC carbon crystal)
  2. Using an input_system (a small water cluster xyz file)

Assertions are intentionally light: we just ensure the CLI completes
without error and that a run directory is created.
