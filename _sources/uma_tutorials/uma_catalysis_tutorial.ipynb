    "## Part 2: Surface Energy Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface energy (γ) quantifies the thermodynamic cost of creating a surface. It determines surface stability, morphology, and catalytic activity. We'll calculate γ for four low-index Ni facets: (111), (100), (110), and (211).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The surface energy is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\gamma = \\frac{E_{\\text{slab}} - N \\cdot E_{\\text{bulk}}}{2A}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $E_{\\text{slab}}$ = total energy of the slab\n",
    "- $N$ = number of atoms in the slab\n",
    "- $E_{\\text{bulk}}$ = bulk energy per atom\n",
    "- $A$ = surface area\n",
    "- Factor of 2 accounts for two surfaces (top and bottom)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge**: Direct calculation suffers from quantum size effects, and if you were doing DFT calculations small numerical errors in the simulation or from the K-point grid sampling can lead to small (but significant) errors in the bulk lattice energy. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: It is fairly common when calculating surface energies to use the bulk energy from a bulk relaxation in the above equation. However, because DFT often has some small numerical noise in the predictions from k-point convergence, this might lead to the wrong surface energy. Instead, two more careful schemes are either:\n",
    "1. Calculate the energy of a bulk structure oriented to each slab to maximize cancellation of small numerical errors or\n",
    "2. Calculate the energy of multiple slabs at multiple thicknesses and extrapolate to zero thickness. The intercept will be the surface energy, and the slope will be a fitted bulk energy. A benefit of this approach is that it also forces us to check that we have a sufficiently thick slab for a well defined surface energy; if the fit is non-linear we need thicker slabs.\n",

    "- **Physical interpretation**: H atoms repel weakly due to electrostatic and Pauli effects\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to Check:**\n",
    "- Your fitted slope should be close to 8.7 kJ/mol per ML\n",
    "- The relationship should be approximately linear for θ < 1 ML\n",
    "- Intercept (E_ads at θ → 0) should match the single-H result from Part 4 (~-0.60 eV)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Variations:**\n",
    "- Slope can vary by ±2-3 kJ/mol depending on slab size and configuration sampling\n",
    "- Non-linearity may appear at very high coverage (θ > 0.75 ML)\n",
    "- Model differences can affect lateral interactions more than adsorption energies\n",

Note that this approach required some insight into what the transition state might look like, and could be considerably more complicated for a reaction that did not involve breaking a single bond."

    "**Expected Results from Paper:**\n",
    "- **Reaction Energy (C* + O* → CO*)**: **-142.7 kJ/mol = -1.48 eV** (exothermic, DFT-D3)\n",
    "- **Activation Barrier (C* + O* → CO*)**: **153 kJ/mol = 1.59 eV** (reverse/dissociation, DFT-D3)\n",
    "- **CO Adsorption Energy**: **1.82 eV = 175.6 kJ/mol** (DFT-D3)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reaction Direction:**\n",
    "- Paper reports CO dissociation barrier (CO* → C* + O*), which is the **reverse** of the recombination we calculate\n",
    "- Forward (C* + O* → CO*): barrier = reverse_barrier - |ΔE| ≈ 1.59 - 1.48 ≈ 0.11 eV (very fast)\n",
    "- Reverse (CO* → C* + O*): barrier = 1.59 eV (very slow, kinetic bottleneck)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to Check:**\n",
    "- Reaction energy (C*+O* → CO*) should be strongly exothermic (~-1.5 eV)\n",
    "- Reverse barrier (CO dissociation) should be substantial (~1.6 eV)\n",
    "- Forward barrier (recombination) should be very small (~0.1 eV)\n",
    "- CO binds much more strongly than H (1.82 eV vs 0.60 eV)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Typical Variations:**\n",
    "- Reaction energies typically accurate within 0.1-0.2 eV\n",
    "- Barriers more sensitive: expect ±0.2-0.3 eV variation\n",
    "- ZPE corrections typically add 0.05-0.15 eV to reaction energies\n",
    "- NEB convergence affects barrier more than reaction energy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical Insight:**\n",
    "- Large reverse barrier (1.59 eV) makes CO dissociation very slow at low T\n",
    "- Small forward barrier (0.11 eV) means C+O rapidly recombine to CO\n",
    "- This explains why Ni produces CO in Fischer-Tropsch rather than keeping C and O separate\n",
    "- High temperatures needed to overcome the dissociation barrier for further C-C coupling\n",

    "## Caveats and Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Important Considerations\n",
    ":class: warning\n",
    "\n",
    "When using ML potentials for surface catalysis, be aware of these critical issues!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Task Selection: OMAT vs OC20\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical choice**: Which task_name to use?\n",
    "- **`task_name=\"omat\"`**: Optimized for bulk and clean surface calculations\n",
    "  - Use for: Part 1 (bulk), Part 2 (surface energies), Part 3 (Wulff)\n",
    "  - Better for structural relaxations without adsorbates\n",
    "- **`task_name=\"oc20\"`**: Optimized for surface chemistry with adsorbates\n",
    "  - Use for: Part 4-6 (all adsorbate calculations)\n",
    "  - Trained on Open Catalyst data with adsorbate-surface interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact**: Using wrong task can lead to 0.1-0.3 eV errors in adsorption energies!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. D3 Dispersion Corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple decisions required**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Whether to use D3 at all?**\n",
    "   - Small adsorbates (H, O, N): D3 effect ~0.01-0.05 eV (often negligible)\n",
    "   - Large molecules (CO, CO₂, aromatics): D3 effect ~0.1-0.3 eV (important!)\n",
    "   - Physisorption: D3 critical (can change binding from repulsive to attractive)\n",
    "   - RPBE was originally fit for chemisorption energies without D3 corrections, so adding D3 corrections may actually cause small adsorbates to overbind. However, it probably would be important for larger molecules. It's relatively uncommon to see RPBE+D3 as a choice in the catalysis literature (compared to PBE+D3, or RPBE, or BEEF-vdW). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which DFT functional for D3?**\n",
    "   - This tutorial uses `method=\"PBE\"` consistently for the D3 correction. This is often implied when papers say they use a D3 correction, but the results can be different if use the RPBE parameterizations.\n",
    "   - Original paper used PBE for bulk/surfaces, RPBE for adsorption. It's not specified what D3 parameterization they used, but it's likely PBE. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **When to apply D3?**\n",
    "   - **End-point correction** (used here): Fast, run ML optimization then add D3 energy\n",
    "   - **During optimization**: Slower but more accurate geometries\n",
    "   - **Impact**: Usually <0.05 eV difference, but can be larger for weak interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Coverage Dependence Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-linearity at high coverage**:\n",
    "- This tutorial assumes linear E_ads(θ) = E₀ + βθ\n",
    "- Reality: Often non-linear, especially near θ = 1 ML. See the plots generated - there is a linear regime for relatively high coverage, and relatively low coverage, but it's not uniformly linear everywhere. As long as you consistently in one regime or the other a linear assumption is probably ok, but you could get into problems if solving microkinetic models where the coverage of the species in question changes significantly from very low to high. \n",
    "- **Why**: Phase transitions, adsorbate ordering, surface reconstruction\n",
    "- **Solution**: Test polynomial fits, look for ordering in visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low coverage limit**:\n",
    "- At θ < 0.1 ML, coverage effects are tiny (<0.01 eV)\n",
    "- Hard to distinguish from numerical noise\n",
    "- **Best practice**: Focus on 0.25-1.0 ML range for fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Periodic Boundary Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "**UMa requires PBC=True in all directions!**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "atoms.set_pbc([True, True, True])  # Always required\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Forgetting this causes crashes or wrong energies\n",
    "- Even for \"gas phase\" molecules in vacuum\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Gas Phase Reference Energies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tricky cases**:\n",
    "- **H₂(g)**: UMa handles well (used in this tutorial)\n",
    "- **H(g)**: May not be reliable (use H₂/2 instead)\n",
    "- **CO(g)**, **O₂(g)**: Usually okay, but check against DFT\n",
    "- **Radicals**: Often problematic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practice**: Always use stable molecules as references (H₂, not H; H₂O, not OH)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Spin Polarization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key limitation**: OC20/UMa does not include spin!\n",
    "- Paper used spin-polarized DFT\n",
    "- **Impact**: Usually small (0.05-0.1 eV)\n",
    "- **Larger** for:\n",
    "  - Magnetic metals (Fe, Co, Ni)\n",
    "  - Open-shell adsorbates (O*, OH*)\n",
    "  - Reaction barriers with radicals\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Constraint Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clean slabs** (Part 2): No constraints (both surfaces relax)\n",
    "- Best for surface energy calculations\n",
    "- More physical for symmetric slabs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adsorbate slabs** (Part 4-6): Bottom layers fixed\n",
    "- Faster convergence\n",
    "- Prevents adsorbate-induced reconstruction\n",
    "- Standard practice in surface chemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fairchem helper functions**: Automatically apply sensible constraints\n",
    "- Trust their heuristics unless you have good reason not to\n",
    "- Check `atoms.constraints` to see what was applied\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Complex Surface Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "**This tutorial uses low-index facets** (111, 100, 110, 211)\n",
    "- Well-defined, symmetric\n",
    "- Easy to generate and analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real catalysts** have:\n",
    "- Steps, kinks, grain boundaries\n",
    "- Support interfaces\n",
    "- Defects and vacancies\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Harder to generate, more configurations to test\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Slab Thickness and Vacuum\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convergence tests critical** but expensive:\n",
    "- This tutorial uses \"reasonable\" values (4-8 layers, 10 Å vacuum)\n",
    "- **Always check** convergence for new systems\n",
    "- **Especially important** for:\n",
    "  - Metals with long electron screening (Au, Ag)\n",
    "  - Charged adsorbates\n",
    "  - Strong adsorbate-induced reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. NEB Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most computationally expensive part**:\n",
    "- May need 7-11 images (not just 5)\n",
    "- Initial guess matters a lot\n",
    "- Can get stuck in local minima\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tricks**:\n",
    "1. Use dimer method to find better TS guess (as shown in Part 6)\n",
    "2. Start with coarse convergence (fmax=0.2), refine later\n",
    "3. Visualize the path - does it make chemical sense?\n",
    "4. Try different spring constants (0.1-1.0 eV/Å)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Lattice Constant Source\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consistency is key**:\n",
    "- Use ML-optimized lattice constant throughout (as done here)\n",
    "- **Don't mix**: ML lattice + DFT surface energies = inconsistent\n",
    "- Alternative: Use experimental lattice constant for everything\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Adsorbate Placement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple local minima**:\n",
    "- Surface chemistry is **not** convex!\n",
    "- Always test multiple adsorption sites\n",
    "- Fairchem helpers generate ~5 configurations in this tutorial, but you may need more to search many modes. You can already try methods like minima hopping or other global optimization methods to sample more configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For complex adsorbates**:\n",
    "- Test different orientations\n",
    "- May need 10-20 configurations\n",
    "- Consider genetic algorithms or basin hopping\n",
