The [FairchemCalculator](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairchem/blob/main/src/fairchem/core/calculate/ase_calculator.py#L3) (an ASE calculator) is simply a convenience wrapper around the MLIPPredictUnit.\n",

    "UMA is designed for both general-purpose usage (single or batched systems) and single-system long rollout (MD simulations, relaxations, etc.). For general-purpose use, we suggest using the [default settings](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairchem/blob/main/src/fairchem/core/units/mlip_unit/api/inference.py#L92). This is a good trade-off between accuracy, speed, and memory consumption and should suffice for most applications. In this setting, on a single 80GB H100 GPU, we expect a user should be able to compute on systems as large as 50k-100k neighbors (depending on their atomic density). Batching is also supported in this mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Turbo mode\n",
    "\n",
    "For long rollout trajectory use-cases, such as molecular dynamics (MD) or relaxations, we provide a special mode called **turbo**, which optimizes for speed but restricts the user to using a single system where the atomic composition is held constant. Turbo mode is approximately 1.5-2x faster than default mode, depending on the situation. However, batching is not supported in this mode. It can be easily activated as shown below."

    "| tf32 | enables torch [tf32](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html) format for matrix multiplication. This will speed up inference at a slight trade-off for precision. In our tests, it makes minimal difference to most applications. It is able to preserve equivariance, energy conservation for long rollouts. However, if you are computing higher order derivatives such as Hessians or other calculations that requires strict numerical precision, we recommend turning this off |\n",
    "| activation_checkpointing | this uses a custom chunked activation checkpointing algorithm and allows significant savings in memory for a small inference speed penalty. If you are predicting on systems >1000 atoms, we recommend keeping this on. However, if you want the absolute fastest inference possible for small systems, you can turn this off |\n",
    "| merge_mole | This is useful in long rollout applications where the system composition stays constant. By pre-merge the MoLE weights, we can save both memory and compute. |\n",
    "| compile | This uses torch.compile to significantly speed up computation. Due to the way pytorch traces the internal graph, it requires a long compile time during the first iteration and can even recompile anytime it detected a significant change in input dimensions. It is not recommended if you are computing frequently on very different atomic systems. |\n",

The graph is chunked into each rank and both the forward and backwards communication is handled by the built-in graph parallel algorithm with torch distributed. Because Multi-GPU inference requires special setup of communication protocols within a node and across nodes, we leverage [ray](https://www.ray.io/) to launch Ray Actors for each GPU-rank under the hood. This allows us to seemlessly scale to any infrastructure that can run Ray.\n",
