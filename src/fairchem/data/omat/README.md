# OMat24 Dataset

> [!CAUTION]
> OMat24 DFT calculations are not compatible with Materials Project calculations. If you are using models trained on OMat24 only
> for such calculations, you can find a OMat24 specific calculations of reference unary compounds and MP2020-style
> anion and GGA/GGA+U mixing corrections in [this repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairchem/tree/main/src/fairchem/data/omat/entries).
> Do not use MP2020 corrections or use the MP references compounds when using OMat24 trained models of OMat24 DFT calculations.
> Additional care must be taken when computing energy differences, such as formation and energy above hull and comparing with
> calculations in the Materials Project since DFT pseudopotentials are different and magnetic ground states may differ as well.

The OMat24 dataset is available for download from [this](https://huggingface.co/datasets/facebook/OMAT24) HuggingFace repo.

Pretrained eqV2 and eSEN models can be downloaded from HuggingFace [here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/OMAT24) and
UMA models [here](https://huggingface.co/facebook/UMA).

The VASP sets used to generate OMat24 data are implemented as `pymatgen` `VaspInputSets`. You can
generate OMat24 VASP inputs as follows,

```bash
:tags: [skip-execution]

pip install fairchem-data-omat
```

```python
from pymatgen.core import Structure, Lattice
from fairchem.data.omat.vasp.sets import OMat24StaticSet

lattice = Lattice.cubic(3.615)

structure = Structure.from_spacegroup(
    "Fm-3m", species=["Cu"], coords=[[0, 0, 0]], lattice=lattice
)

input_set = OMat24StaticSet(structure)
input_set.write_input("path/to/input-dir")
```
